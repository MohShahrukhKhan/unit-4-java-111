Static variable	                                                                    Non static variable
Static variables can be accessed using class name	                        Non static variables can be accessed using instance of a class
Static variables can be accessed by static and non static methods	        Non static variables cannot be accessed inside a static method.
Static variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.  	        Non static variables do not reduce the amount of memory used by a program
Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.	                Non static variables are specific to that instance of a class.
Static variable is like a global variable and is available to all methods.	Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.


Static method vs Non-static method
The Common functionality of all objects in the application must be defined as
static.
Non-static functionality belongs to a particular object.
Example:
For an ATM application:
Static method: To Launch a welcome screen
Non-static method: To Launch a transaction screen

package com.masai;
public class Account
{
   static String bankName;
   long accountNumber;
   String accountHolderName;
   double balance;
   public static void main(String[] args){
      Account.bankName="SBI";
      Account ac1=new Account();
      ac1.accountHolderName="Ramesh";
      ac1.accountNumber=13422323432L;
      ac1.balance=5000;
      Account ac2=new Account();
      ac2.accountHolderName="Amit";
      ac2.accountNumber=25422323432L;
      ac2.balance=6000;
      System.out.println("Account 1 details");
      System.out.println(ac1.bankName);
      System.out.println(ac1.accountHolderName);
      System.out.println(ac1.balance);
      System.out.println("======================");
      System.out.println("Account 2 details");
      System.out.println(ac2.bankName);
      System.out.println(ac2.accountHolderName);
      System.out.println(ac2.balance);
   }
}
