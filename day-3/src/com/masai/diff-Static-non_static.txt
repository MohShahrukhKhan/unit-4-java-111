Static variable	Non static variable
Static variables can be accessed using class name	                        Non static variables can be accessed using instance of a class
Static variables can be accessed by static and non static methods	        Non static variables cannot be accessed inside a static method.
Static variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.  	        Non static variables do not reduce the amount of memory used by a program
Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.	                Non static variables are specific to that instance of a class.
Static variable is like a global variable and is available to all methods.	Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.
